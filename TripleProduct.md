# Triple Product



## Scalar triple product
The **scalar triple product** (also called the **mixed product**, **box product**, <br>
or **triple scalar product**) is defined as the dot product of one of the vectors with <br>
the cross product of the other two.

Let $`a`, $`b`$, $`c`$ are vectors, then $`\mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{b}\times \mathbf{c})`$ is **scalar triple product**.

### Property

#### $`a \cdot (b \times c) = b \cdot (c \times a) = c \cdot (a \times b)`$ 
The scalar triple product is unchanged under a **circular shift** of its three operands $`(a, b, c)`$:
$`a \cdot (b \times c) = b \cdot (c \times a) = c \cdot (a \times b)`$

#### $`a \cdot (b \times c) = (a \times b) \cdot c`$
Swapping the positions of the operators without re-ordering the operands leaves <br>
the triple product unchanged. 

#### Swapping any two of the three operands negates the triple product. 
$`a \cdot (b \times c) = -a \cdot (c \times b) = -b \cdot (a \times c) = -c \cdot (b \times a)`$

#### If $`a \cdot (b \times c) = 0`$, then $`a`$, $`b`$, and $`c`$ coplanar
If the scalar triple product is equal to zero, then the three vectors a, b, and c are **coplanar**, <br>
since the parallelepiped defined by them would be flat and have no volume.

#### Any two vectors in the scalar triple product are equal, then its value is zero:

$`{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} \cdot (\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} )=\mathbf {a} \cdot (\mathbf {b} \times \mathbf {a} )=\mathbf {a} \cdot (\mathbf {b} \times \mathbf {b} )=\mathbf {b} \cdot (\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {a} )=0}`$

#### ????

$`{\displaystyle (\mathbf {a} \cdot (\mathbf {b} \times \mathbf {c} ))\,\mathbf {a} =(\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} )\times (\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {c} )}`$

#### The ratio of the triple product and the product of the three vector norms is known as a **polar sine**:
