# Subspace

## Definition

A subspace of a vector space $`V`$ is a subset $`U`$ of $`V`$ which

1. contains the zero vector $`0_{v}`$,
2. is closed under **addition**, meaning that for all $`v, w \in U`$ we have $`v + w \in U`$, and
3. is closed under **scalar multiplication**, meaning that for all scalars $`\lambda`$ <br>
 and all $`u \in U`$ we have $`\lambda u \in U`$.

We write $`V \leq U`$ to mean that $`V`$ is a subspace of $`U`$.
