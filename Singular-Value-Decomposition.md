# Singular Value Decomposition (奇异值分解)

The singular value decomposition of a matrix $`A`$ is the factorization of $`A`$ into the <br>
product of three matrices $`A = UDV^{T}`$ where the columns of $`U`$ and $`V`$ are orthonormal and <br>
the matrix $`D`$ is diagonal with positive real entries. <sup>[1]</sup>
