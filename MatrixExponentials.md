# Matrix Exponentials

## Exponential Function [^2] [^3]
The exponential function is a type of mathematical function which are helpful <br>
in finding the growth or decay of population, money, price, etc that are <br> 
growing or decay exponentially. 

Exponential function has a constant as its base and a variable as its exponent. <br>
The $`f`$ is an exponential function with parameter $`c`$ and $`b`$. <br>
$`f(x)=cb^x`$ <br>
When $`c=1, b=e`$, we get the following: <br>
$`f(x)=e^x`$

### Power function [^2]
Power function is a function which has a variable as the base and a constant as the exponent, 
$`f(x)=x^a`$.

### Exponential Series [^2]
$`e^x=`$
