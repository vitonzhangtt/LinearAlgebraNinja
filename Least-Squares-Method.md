# Least Squares Method

## What's it? 

It demonstrates how to find the **least squares solution** to an **overdetermined** linear system <br>
which *lacks an exact solution*. It explains that this method is applicable in fields like <br>
**data science** and **machine learning**. <sup>[1]</sup>

Least square method is the process of finding a regression line or best-fitted line for any data set <br>
that is described by an equation. This method requires reducing the sum of the squares of the <br>
residual parts of the points from the curve or line and the trend of outcomes is found quantitatively. <sup>[2]</sup>

Our main objective in this method is to *reduce the sum of the squares of errors* as much as possible. <br>
This is the reason this method is called the least-squares method. <sup>[2]</sup>

The method of least squares is a statistical technique used to find the best-fitting curve or line <br>
for a set of data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the **vertical distances** (**residuals**) <br> 
between the points and the curve. It is a common approach in regression analysis to find the best-fit <br>
line that represents the trend of a data set. This method is used in various fields, like finance and <br>
sciences, to model relationships between variables and make predictions. <sup>Google AI Overview</sup>

## Applications <sup>Google AI Overview</sup>
* Regression analysis: It is a core component of regression analysis, which is used to estimate the <br>
  relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
* Forecasting: It helps in creating predictive models to forecast trends and future outcomes. 
* Curve fitting: It can be used to fit a curve, not just a straight line, to a set of data points.

## Limitations for Least Square Method <sup>[2]</sup>

Even though the least-squares method is considered the best method to find the line of best fit, <br>
it has a few limitations. They are:

* This method exhibits only the relationship between the two variables. All other causes and effects <br>
  are not taken into consideration.
* This method is unreliable when data is not evenly distributed.
* This method is very sensitive to outliers. In fact, this can skew the results of the least-squares analysis.

## Least Square Method Formula

Theorem Let $`A`$ be an $`m√ón`$ matrix and let $`b`$ be a vector in $`R^{m}`$. <br>
The least-squares solutions of $`Ax=b`$ are the solutions of the matrix equation <sup>[4]</sup> <br>

$`A^{T}Ax=A^{T}b`$
