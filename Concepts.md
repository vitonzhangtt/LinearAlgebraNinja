## column space

## nullspace
A is a matrix with $`m \times n`$.
The nullspace $`N(A)`$ consists of all solutions to $`A\mathbf{x}=0`$. These vectors $`\mathbf{x}`$ are in $`R^n`$.

## skew-symmetric matrix
In mathematics, a skew symmetric matrix is defined as the square matrix that is equal 
to the negative of its transpose matrix. <br>
For any square matrix, $`A`$, the transpose matrix is given as $`A^T`$. <br>
A skew-symmetric or antisymmetric matrix $`A`$ can therefore be represented 
as, $`A = -A^T`$
