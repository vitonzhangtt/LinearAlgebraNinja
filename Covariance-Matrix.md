# Covariance Matrix


A covariance matrix is a **square, symmetric matrix** that summarizes the **pairwise relationships** <br>
between several variables in a dataset. It is also known as the **variance-covariance matrix** because <br>
its main diagonal contains the **variances** of each individual variable, while the **off-diagonal** <br>
elements contain the covariances between each pair of variables.
