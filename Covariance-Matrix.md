# Covariance Matrix


A covariance matrix is a **square, symmetric matrix** that summarizes the **pairwise relationships** <br>
between several variables in a dataset. It is also known as the **variance-covariance matrix** because <br>
its main diagonal contains the **variances** of each individual variable, while the **off-diagonal** <br>
elements contain the **covariances** between each pair of variables.

* A **positive covariance** means the two variables tend to move in the **same direction** (as one increases, <br>
  the other tends to increase).
* A negative covariance means they tend to move in **opposite directions** (as one increases, the other <br>
  tends to decrease).
* A covariance near zero indicates no consistent linear relationship between the variables.
