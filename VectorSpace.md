# Vector Space

In mathematics and physics, a **vector space** (also called a **linear space**) is a **set** whose elements, <br>
often called **vectors**, can be *added together* and *multiplied ("scaled") by numbers* called **scalars**. <br>
The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, <br>
called **vector axioms**. <sup>[3]</sup>
